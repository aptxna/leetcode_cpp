/**
 * Delete Node in a Linked List
 * 
 * Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
 * Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3,
 * the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.
 * 
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 *
 * 这道题没给出list的头结点，返回也是void，只给出了要删除的结点
